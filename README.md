This project is under development by Sam Parry, undergraduate researcher with the M' Lab at the University of Utah. 

The goal of this project is to develop a means of performing feature engineering and selection on FEA (Finite Element Analysis) data. This project aims to do this by building on the abilities of existing machine learning algorithms in packages such as [BINGO][1], [feat][2], and others.
