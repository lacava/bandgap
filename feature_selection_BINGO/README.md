# BINGO

[BINGO][1]	is an open source GPSR algorithm developed by NASA and used extensively by members of the M' Lab at the University of Utah. 
This package contains attempts at using BINGO to derive superfeatures from a set of numerical data generated by PhD sudent Hongsup Oh. 

The current approach using BINGO has been unsuccessful and new approaches using other GPSR packages are being investigated.
